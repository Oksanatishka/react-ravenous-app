In total, there will be four parts to this project:
1) Creating Static Components
    Ravenous will be composed of four different components interacting with each other:
        <Business />
        <BusinessList />
        <SearchBar />
        <App /> (created by default with create-react-app)
2) Passing Information to Components
3) Setting the State of Ravenous Components
4) Interacting with the Yelp API

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------- 1) Creating Static Components -------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a React App
    1. Start by creating a React app using the create-react-app package in your preferred terminal.
        > create-react-app ravenous
    2. In another terminal window, cd into the Ravenous directory and type the following command:
        > npm start
    3. Replace the current favicon located at public/favicon.ico with this icon. Make sure you save the new image as favicon.ico.
Add a CSS Reset
    1. add a reset.css file in the public/ directory to ensure our app is styled the same in every browser. Copy and paste this CSS into reset.css.
    2. Link to reset.css in the index.html file that’s also located in the public/ directory.
Add Google Fonts
    1. You’ll also need to add a couple of Google fonts that the app will use. In index.html, add the following links to add the necessary Google fonts:
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Work+Sans:300,500,600" rel="stylesheet">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:600" rel="stylesheet">
Create Business.js
    1. cd into the src/ directory. Create a new folder called components. 
    2. Each component should have its own folder inside of components/. Inside of the components/ directory create a new folder called App.
        Move App.js and App.css to the App/ folder and update the path in index.js accordingly.
        Remove App.test.js from the src/ folder, as you will not use it in this project.
    3. Inside of components/, create a new folder called Business. cd into the Business/ directory and create two files:
        Business.js
        Business.css
Create a Sample Business
    The purpose of the <Business /> component is to represent how a business (a restaurant) in Ravenous will be formatted and styled. For now, we’ll hard code a single business listing. Later, you’ll update it dynamically using the Yelp API.
    1. Open Business.js in your text editor. Create a JavaScript object called business. Copy the following keys and values and add them to business:
            imageSrc: 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/ravenous/pizza.jpg',
            name: 'MarginOtto Pizzeria',
            address: '1010 Paddington Way',
            city: 'Flavortown',
            state: 'NY',
            zipCode: '10101',
            category: 'Italian',
            rating: 4.5,
            reviewCount: 90
Import React
    1. At the very top of your Business.js file (line 1), import React.
Create the <Business /> Component
    1. Below the business object, create a React component called Business. The component should extend React.Component.
    2. Add a .render() method to the Business component.
    3. Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.
Import Business.css
    1. Create a new file called Business.css in the Business/ directory. Add this CSS to to the Business.css file.
    2. At the top of Business.js (line 2), import the Business.css file. 
Export the <Business /> Component
    1. At the bottom of the file (last line), export the Business component.
Create BusinessList.js and BusinessList.css
    1. Inside of BusinessList folder, create two files:
        BusinessList.js
        BusinessList.css
    2. Add the following CSS to BusinessList.css:
        .BusinessList {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: space-around;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
          margin: 4.4rem 10%;
        }
Import React and BusinessList.css
    1. Start by opening BusinessList.js. At the top of the file, import the following (in this order):
        The React library
        BusinessList.css
Import the <Business /> Component
Create the <BusinessList /> Component
    1. Use the React library to create a component called BusinessList.
    2. Inside of the component, add a render() method.
Rendering <Business />
    1. Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.
Export the <BusinessList /> Component
Create SearchBar.js
    1. Inside of SearchBar folder, create two files:
        SearchBar.js
        SearchBar.css
    2. Add this CSS to the SearchBar.css file. Here are the two images you’ll need for the project: Ravenous (desktop size), Ravenous (mobile size).
Import React and SearchBar.css
    1. Start by opening SearchBar.js. At the top of the file, import the following (in this order):
        The React library
        SearchBar.css
Create an Options Object
    The search bar will communicate with the Yelp API, but you’ll build the functionality to communicate with the API in a later project. Today, you’ll build part of the structure that’s needed to communicate with the Yelp API.
    Specifically, requests to the Yelp API must follow formatting and naming conventions set by the API. 
    https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search
    For example, the search bar should allow users to search businesses by:
        Best Match
        Highest Rated
        Most Reviewed
    To achieve this, you’ll create an object with keys and values that conform to what the API expects to receive(as shown in the documentation provided above).
    1. Start by creating an object called sortByOptions.
    2. The object should have three keys (in this order):
            Best Match
            Highest Rated
            Most Reviewed
        Make sure the keys are strings.
    3. Set the values. Use the documentation to help you set the values of those keys. The sort_by entry in the table of the “Parameters” section will be helpful. The values should be strings.
Create the <SearchBar /> Component
Create renderSortByOptions()
    1. Create a method called renderSortByOptions() in the body of the component declaration.
    2. The method should iterate through the keys and values of the sortByOptions object and return a list item. The list item elements should use the keys as an attribute, and the values as content. Let’s start building it out. Start adding a return statement (no parentheses).
    3. Call the keys() method on the JavaScript Object library. Pass in sortByOptions as the argument.
    4. Now that you have access to the keys, you’ll iterate through them using the map() method. Call the map() method by chaining it to the end of the line you just wrote.
    5. Pass a callback function to the map() method as an argument. The callback function should have one parameter called sortByOption. The callback function should also use arrow syntax.
    6. Now let’s store the object values in a variable. Inside of the callback function, access the sortByOptions values using the sortByOption parameter of the callback function. Store values in variable called sortByOptionValue.
    7. On the next line, return a <li> element. The list item should have an attribute called key set to sortByOptionValue (don’t forget to use curly braces to inject JavaScript). The content of the list item should be sortByOption. Again, use curly braces to achieve the JavaScript injection.
Render the <SearchBar /> Component
    1. Start by adding a render() method.
    2. Inside of the .render() method, add a return statement with JSX that renders this HTML.
Export the <SearchBar /> Component
Import React and App.css
    1. At the top of App.js, import the the following (in this order):
            The React library
            App.css
        Make sure that App.css has this CSS.
Import <BusinessList /> and <SearchBar />
Modify the Default <App /> Component
    1. Delete everything inside of the return statement.
Render Ravenous
    1. Inside of the App.js .render() method, return JSX that renders this HTML.
Export <App />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create businesses Array
    When the Yelp API is implemented, a list of businesses will be returned to App.js.
    1. Open Business.js. Cut the entire business object and paste it into App.js. Make sure to paste it right after the imports and above the App class declaration.
    We’ll refactor BusinessList's div to remove some of the component repetition.
    2. Go back to App.js. Under the business object, create a businesses array. The array should hold six references to the business object.
Setting a BusinessList Prop
    1. In app.js, add a businesses property to the <BusinessList /> component inside of the render() method. Set the property equal to the businesses array. (Don’t forget your curly braces!)
Add Functionality to the BusinessList Prop
    1. Open BusinessList.js. Remove everything inside of the BusinessList div (the repeated components). Inside of the BusinessList div, access the businesses prop and call the .map() method on it.
    2. Inside of the map() method, pass a callback function with one parameter called business.
    3. The callback function should return a <Business /> component. The returned <Business /> should have a property called business. Set the property equal to the parameter of the callback function. (Don’t forget your curly braces and semicolon!)
Modifying Business.js using Props
    1. Business information now has to be accessed via the business prop you set in BusinessList.js. Modify all statements (like the one in the example above) by prepending them with this.props.
Completion and Reflection

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------- 3) Setting the State of Ravenous Components -------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add a SearchBar Constructor
    1. Open SearchBar.js. Add a constructor in the SearchBar component. Make sure to pass the constructor props and call super(props) on the first line.
    2. Inside of the constructor, set the initial state of the search bar. Use this.state and set it equal to an empty object.
    3. Add three keys to the state object you just created. The keys should be term, location, and sortBy. The first two keys should be set to empty strings (''). The last key should be set to 'best_match'. This completes the constructor.
Get a Sort Option's Class
    Click on the sort options above the two input elements on the Ravenous page. You’ll notice that nothing happens. They remain the same color and there is no way to determine which option has been selected.
    1. Move the sortByOptions object to the last line of the constuctor() and change it from a local variable to a member variable using this. Be sure to also update the two references to sortByOptions in the renderSortByOptions() method to now use this. Update the two references to sortByOptions in the renderSortByOptions() method to now use this.
        Then, add a new method called getSortByClass after the constructor() that accepts one parameter called sortByOption.
    2. Inside, use an if statement to check if the state value of sortBy is equal to the provided sortByOption. If it is, return 'active', otherwise, return an empty string ('').
Handle a Change in Sort Option
    1. Add a new method called handleSortByChange. It should accept a parameter called sortByOption.
    2. Inside of .handleSortByChange(), update the state by calling .setState(). Pass in an object to setState(). The object should set sortBy to the value of the method’s argument.
Set the Class Name of a Sort Option
    1. Take a look at the .renderSortByOptions() method.
        Add a className attribute to the <li> element. Set it equal to the return value of the getSortByClass() method. Pass in sortByOptionValue as the argument.
        This will conditionally style each sort by option, displaying to the user which sorting option is currently selected.
Handle a Sorting Option Change (On Click)
    This will allow us to both bind to the current value of this (as we usually do in the constructor()) but also bind the current sortByOptionValue as the first argument to the method call, ensuring the method is called with the appropriate value when clicked.
    1. Add an onClick attribute to the <li> element. Set it equal to handleSortByChange.bind(). Pass in two arguments to .bind(): this and sortByOptionValue.
Handle a Term or Location Change
    1. Under the handleSortByChange() method, add two new methods:
        handleTermChange()
        handleLocationChange()
        Since both will be related to events being triggered, both should accept event as an argument.
    2. Inside of each method, update the state using setState(). Pass in an empty object into each call of setState().
    3. In .handleTermChange(), the object passed to .setState() should have a key called term. Set the key to a value of event.target.value.
    4. Do the same thing in .handleLocationChange(), but name the key location instead.
Bind Methods in the Constructor
    Since both of these methods use this, you’ll need to bind them. 
    1. Above the sortByOptions object in the constructor(), bind both methods (handleTermChange() and handleLocationChange()) to the current value of this.
Handle a Term or Location Change (onChange)
    1. Inside of the return statement of the component’s render() method, add onChange attributes to each <input> element:
        Set the first attribute to handle term changes.
        Set the second attribute to handle location changes.
searchYelp() in the App Component
    The “Let’s Go” button also needs to provide some sort of feedback to the user. Currently, clicking on it doesn’t do anything.
    1. In App.js, add a method called searchYelp() in the class declaration of the App component. (Place it above the render() method.)
    2. searchYelp() should accept three parameters: term, location, and sortBy.
    3. Inside of searchYelp(), log a message to the console that uses the three parameters.
        Here’s an example message: Searching Yelp with Pizza, Brooklyn, best_match
Set the searchYelp Prop in SearchBar
    1. Add a searchYelp property to the SearchBar component in the return statement of .render(). Set it equal to this.searchYelp.
Handle a Search
    1. In SearchBar.js, add a method called handleSearch(). Place it under the handleLocationChange() method.
    2. .handleSearch() should accept an event parameter. Inside of .handleSearch(), call the passed down .searchYelp() method (located on props). Pass in the current state values of term, location, and sortBy as arguments.
    3. On the next line, call event.preventDefault() to prevent the default action of clicking a link from triggering at the end of the method.
Bind handleSearch()
    1. Next, bind the handleSearch() method. Place it under three methods you previously bound.
Handle a Search (onClick)
    1. Add an onClick attribute to the “Let’s Go” button. Set it equal to this.handleSearch.
Completion and Reflection
    Review what you built:
        Added visual feedback for the sorting options at the top of the search bar
        Set the state of sorting options and input elements
        Simulated a search query with the “Let’s Go” button
